; Exercise 2.46. A two-dimensional vector v running from the origin to a point can be
; represented as a pair consisting of an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate.
; Implement a data abstraction for vectors by giving a constructor
; make-vect and corresponding selectors xcor-vect and ycor-vect.
; In terms of your selectors and constructor, implement procedures
; add-vect, sub-vect, and scale-vect that perform the operations vector addition,
; vector subtraction, and multiplying a vector by a scalar:

(define (make-vect x y)
  (cons x y))

(define xcor-vect car)
(define ycor-vect cdr)

(define (add-vect v1 v2)
  (make-vect (+ (xcor-vect v1)
                (xcor-vect v2))
             (+ (ycor-vect v1)
                (ycor-vect v2))))

(define (sub-vect v1 v2)
  (make-vect (- (xcor-vect v1)
                (xcor-vect v2))
             (- (ycor-vect v1)
                (ycor-vect v2))))

(define (scale v s)
  (make-vect (* s (xcor-vect v)) (* s (ycor-vect v))))
