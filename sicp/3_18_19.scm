; Exercise 3.18. Write a procedure that examines a list and determines whether it contains a cycle,
; that is, whether a program that tried to find the end of the list by taking
; successive cdrs would go into an infinite loop. Exercise 3.13 constructed such lists.

; Exercise 3.19. Redo exercise 3.18 using an algorithm that takes
; only a constant amount of space. (This requires a very clever idea.)

; Answer:
; One go 1, One go 2; When they met, loop found.
