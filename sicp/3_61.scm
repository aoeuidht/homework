; Exercise 3.61. Let S be a power series (exercise 3.59) whose constant term
; is 1. Suppose we want to find the power series 1/S, that is, 
; the series X such that S Â· X = 1. Write S = 1 + SR where SR is
; the part of S after the constant term. Then we can solve for X as follows:

; In other words, X is the power series whose constant term is 1 and 
; whose higher-order terms are given by the negative of SR times X. 
; Use this idea to write a procedure invert-unit-series that computes 1/S
; for a power series S with constant term 1. You will need to use mul-series from exercise 3.60.

(define (invert-unit-series s)
  (cons-stream 1
               (scale-stream (mul-series (stream-cdr s)
                                         (invelt-unit-series s))
                             -1)))
