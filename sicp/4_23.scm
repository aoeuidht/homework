Exercise 4.23.  Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't understand why analyze-sequence needs to be so complicated.
 All the other analysis procedures are straightforward transformations of the corresponding evaluation
 procedures (or eval clauses) in section 4.1.1. She expected analyze-sequence to look like this:

(define (analyze-sequence exps)
  (define (execute-sequence procs env)
    (cond ((null? (cdr procs)) ((car procs) env))
          (else ((car procs) env)
                (execute-sequence (cdr procs) env))))
  (let ((procs (map analyze exps)))
    (if (null? procs)
        (error "Empty sequence -- ANALYZE"))
    (lambda (env) (execute-sequence procs env))))

Eva Lu Ator explains to Alyssa that the version in the text does more of the work of evaluating a sequence
 at analysis time. Alyssa's sequence-execution procedure, rather than having the calls to the individual
 execution procedures built in, loops through the procedures in order to call them: In effect, although
 the individual expressions in the sequence have been analyzed, the sequence itself has not been.

Compare the two versions of analyze-sequence. For example, consider the common case (typical of procedure
 bodies) where the sequence has just one expression. What work will the execution procedure produced by
 Alyssa's program do? What about the execution procedure produced by the program in the text above? 
How do the two versions compare for a sequence with two expressions?

; Ansver
; The A version performs like
(map (lambda (p) (p env))
     (map analyze exps))

; It does more work than the text version.
