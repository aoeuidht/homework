Exercise 5.6.  Ben Bitdiddle observes that the Fibonacci machine's controller sequence has an 
extra save and an extra restore, which can be removed to make a faster machine. 
Where are these instructions?

; Answer

; any continue assignment needs no restore

(controller
   (assign continue (label fib-done))
 fib-loop
   (test (op <) (reg n) (const 2))
   (branch (label immediate-answer))
   ;; set up to compute Fib(n - 1)
   (save continue)
   (assign continue (label afterfib-n-1))
   (save n)                           ; save old value of n
   (assign n (op -) (reg n) (const 1)); clobber n to n - 1
   (goto (label fib-loop))            ; perform recursive call
 afterfib-n-1                         ; upon return, val contains Fib(n - 1)
   (restore n)
   ; --------------------------------- (restore continue)
   ;; set up to compute Fib(n - 2)
   (assign n (op -) (reg n) (const 2))
   ; --------------------------------- (save continue)
   (assign continue (label afterfib-n-2))
   (save val)                         ; save Fib(n - 1)
   (goto (label fib-loop))
 afterfib-n-2                         ; upon return, val contains Fib(n - 2)
   (assign n (reg val))               ; n now contains Fib(n - 2)
   (restore val)                      ; val now contains Fib(n - 1)
   (restore continue)
   (assign val                        ;  Fib(n - 1) +  Fib(n - 2)
           (op +) (reg val) (reg n)) 
   (goto (reg continue))              ; return to caller, answer is in val
 immediate-answer
   (assign val (reg n))               ; base case:  Fib(n) = n
   (goto (reg continue))
   fib-done)
