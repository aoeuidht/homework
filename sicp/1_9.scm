; Exercise 1.9. Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers
; in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its argument by 1, and dec,
; which decrements its argument by 1.
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))

; Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5).
; Are these processes iterative or recursive?

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

; (+ 4 5) extends to
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
; (+ 4 5) extends to
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)

; so the first one is a recirsive process and the 2nd one is an iterative process.
