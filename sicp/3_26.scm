; Exercise 3.26. To search a table as implemented above, one needs to scan 
; through the list of records. This is basically the unordered list representation of section 2.3.3.
; For large tables, it may be more efficient to
; structure the table in a different manner. Describe a table implementation where the (key, value)
; records are organized using a binary tree, assuming that keys can be ordered in some way
; (e.g., numerically or alphabetically). (Compare exercise 2.66 of chapter 2.)

; Answer
; to do this, You have to write a ``red-black tree``, which is introduced in chapteer 13,
; Introduction to Algorithms, and I'll do that when I'm reading that book.
