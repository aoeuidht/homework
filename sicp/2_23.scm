; Exercise 2.23. The procedure for-each is similar to map. It takes as arguments a procedure and a list of elements.
; However, rather than forming a list of the results,
; for-each just applies the procedure to each of the elements in turn,
; from left to right. The values returned by applying the procedure to the elements are not used at all
; -- for-each is used with procedures that perform an action, such as printing. For example,

;(for-each (lambda (x) (newline) (display x))
;(list 57 321 88))
;The value returned by the call to for-each (not illustrated above) can be something arbitrary, such as
;true. Give an implementation of for-each.

(define (for-each oper items)
  (if (null? items)
      #t
      (begin (oper (car items))
             (for-each oper (cdr items)))))

(for-each (lambda (x) (newline) (display x))
          (list 57 321 88))
