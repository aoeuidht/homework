; Exercise 3.21. Ben Bitdiddle decides to test the queue implementation described above. He types in the
; procedures to the Lisp interpreter and proceeds to try them out:
; (define q1 (make-queue))
; (insert-queue! q1 'a)
; ((a) a)
; (insert-queue! q1 'b)
; ((a b) b)
; (delete-queue! q1)
; ((b) b)
; (delete-queue! q1)
; (() b)

; ``It's all wrong!'' he complains. ``The interpreter's response shows that the last item is inserted into the
; queue twice. And when I delete both items, the second b is still there, so the queue isn't empty, even
; though it's supposed to be.'' Eva Lu Ator suggests that Ben has misunderstood what is happening. ``It's not
; that the items are going into the queue twice,'' she explains. ``It's just that the standard Lisp printer doesn't
; know how to make sense of the queue representation. If you want to see the queue printed correctly, you'll
; have to define your own print procedure for queues.'' Explain what Eva Lu is talking about. In particular,
; show why Ben's examples produce the printed results that they do. Define a procedure print-queue
; that takes a queue as input and prints the sequence of items in the queue.

(define (print-queue queue)
