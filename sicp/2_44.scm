; Exercise 2.44. Define the procedure up-split used by corner-split.
; It is similar to right- split, except that it switches the roles of below and beside.
(define (corner-split painter n)
  (if (= n 0)
      painter
      (let ((up (up-split painter (- n 1)))
            (right (right-split painter (- n 1))))

              (bottom-right (below right right))
              (corner (corner-split painter (- n 1))))
          (beside (below painter top-left)
                  (below bottom-right corner))))))
