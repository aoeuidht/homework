We can use any data structure for representing environments, 
if we can distinguish empty environments from non-empty ones, 
and in which one can extract the pieces of a non-empty environment. 
Implement environments using a representation in which the empty 
environment is represented as the empty list, 
and in which extend-env builds an environment that looks like

...

This is called an a-list or association-list representation.
