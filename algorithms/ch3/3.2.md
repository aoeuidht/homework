### 3.2.3

__Give five orderings of the keys A X C S E R H that, when inserted into an initially empty BST, produce the best-case tree.__

The final tree is:

```
            H
           / \
          /   \
         E     R
        / \   /  \
       A   C S    X
```

We start from the ``E A C`` sub tree, E must be appear before A C, the order of A C doesn't matter.

so they are

> E A C
or
> E C A

also for R S X

> R S X
or
> R X S

and H-E-R tree also the same.

so we got the answers:

> H E A C R S X
> H E C A R S X
> H E A C R X S
> H E C A R X S

now we got four. also we can mix the E sub tree and R sub tree together.

> H E R A C S X
> H E R C A S X
...
