### 3.2.3

__Give five orderings of the keys A X C S E R H that, when inserted into an initially empty BST, produce the best-case tree.__

The final tree is:

```
            H
           / \
          /   \
         E     R
        / \   /  \
       A   C S    X
```

We start from the ``E A C`` sub tree, E must be appear before A C, the order of A C doesn't matter.

so they are

> E A C
or
> E C A

also for R S X

> R S X
or
> R X S

and H-E-R tree also the same.

so we got the answers:

> H E A C R S X
> H E C A R S X
> H E A C R X S
> H E C A R X S

now we got four. also we can mix the E sub tree and R sub tree together.

> H E R A C S X
> H E R C A S X
...


### 3.2.6

__Add to BST.java a method height() that computes the height of the tree. Develop two implementations: a recursive method (which takes linear time and space proportional to the height), and method like size() that adds a field to each node in the tree (and takes linear space and constant time per query).__

the recursion version is below:

```python
def tree_height(tree):
    lh = rh = 0
    if tree.left:
       lh = tree_height(tree.left)
    if tree.right:
       rh = tree_height(tree.right)
    return 1 + max(lh, rh)
```

the original version see 3.2.6

### 3.2.14
__Give nonrecursive implementations of min(), max(), floor(), ceiling(), rank(), and select().__

see 3.2.14.py


### 3.2.38 Tree Drawing

__Add a method draw() to BST that draws BST figures in the style of the text. Hint: Use instance variables to hold node coordinates, and use a recursive method to set the values of these variables.__

See 3.2.14.py
