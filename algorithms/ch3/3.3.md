### 3.3.3 Find an insrtion order for the keys SEARCHXM that leads to a 2-3 tree of height 1.

> E A C R S H M X

### 3.3.9

__Which of the following are red-black BSTS?__

> C D

### 3.3.24 worst case for red-black BSTs.

__Show how to construct a red-black BST demonstrating that, in the worst case, almost all the paths from the root to a null link in a red-black BST of N nodes are of length 2lg^N__

this exercuise has the same answer to _3.3.3_


### 3.3.25 top-down 2-3-4 trees.

__Develop an implementation of the basic symbol-table API that uses balasced 2-3-4 trees as the underlying data structure, using the red-black representation and the insertion method described in the text, where 4-node are split by flipping colors on the way down the search path and balancing on the way bup.__

see 3.3.25.py

### 3.3.28 Bottom-up 2-3-4 trees.

__Develop an implementation of the basic symbol-table API that uses balanced 2-3-4 trees as the underlying data struct, using the red-black representation and a bottom-up insertion method based on the same recursive approach as ALGORITHM 3.4. Your insertion method should split only the sequence of 4-nodes (if any) on the bottom of search path.__
