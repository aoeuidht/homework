### 2.4.10

__Suppose thant we wish to avoid wasting one position in a heap-ordered array pq[], putting the largest value in pq[0], its children in pq[1] and pq[2], and so forth, proceeding in level order. when are the parents and children of pq[k]?__

```python
father = lambda idx: ((idx-1)<<1) if idx else None
left_son = lambda idx: idx * 2 + 1
right_son = lambda idx: idx * (2 + 1)
```


### 2.4.13

__Describe a way to avoid the j<N test in sink()__

the _j<N_ test is to makesure finding the bigger son node for a father, so if we can guarantee the baigger son is alway in the left node, we can ignore the j<N check. This should be don in _swim_ function.

### 2.4.27 Find the minimum

__Add a min() method to MaxPQ. Your implementation should be use constant time and constant extra space.__

just search the last-leaf node till(not include) its father node.
