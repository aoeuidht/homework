### 2.5.1

__Consider the following implementation of the compareTo() method for String. How does the third line help with efficiency?__

```Java
public int compareTo(String that)
{
    if (this == that) return 0;  // this line
    int n = Math.min(this.length(), that.length());
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        if      (this.charAt(i) < that.charAt(i)) return -1;
        else if (this.charAt(i) > that.charAt(i)) return +1;
    }
    return this.length() - that.length();
}
```

The 3rd line is used for comparing the same string. It will return the result directly.

### 2.5.2

__Write a program that reads a list of words from standard input and prints all two-word compound words in the list__

For example, if _after_, _thought_, and _afterthought_ are in the list, then _afterthought_ is a compound word.

```python
def fnd_cmpnd(list_file):
    with open(list_file) as f:
        words = f.readlines()
        words.sort()
        for idx in range(0, len(words)-1):
            for n in xrange(idx+1, len(words)):
                if not words[n].startswith(words[idx]):
                    break
                if words.find(words[n][len(words[idx]:])+1:
                    print words[n]
                    break
```

### 2.5.3

__Criticize the following implementation of a class intended to represent customer account balances. Why is compareTo() a flawed implementation of the Comparable interface?__

```java
public class Customer implements Comparable<Customer> {
    private String name;
    private double balance;
    
    public int compareTo(Customer that) {
        if (this.balance < that.balance - 0.005) return -1;
        if (this.balance > that.balance + 0.005) return +1; 
        return 0;
    }
}
```

let's assume a is 1.003, b is 1.006, c is 1.009, so we can get __a == b; b==c; a < c__ at the same time, which is wrong.

To avoid this, zoom the balance, convert to integer before comparet, instead of ignoring the difference.

### 2.5.8

__Write a program frequency that reads strings from standard input and prints the number of times each string occurs, in descending order of frequency.__


__descending order of frequency__ also means __descending order of number occurs__, so we can just use a ``minium-heap`` to save the occur numbers. when adding a word, use M(number of distinct keys) to find the node, lg^M to sink the heap to order.

### 2.5.10

Use a inserct-sort, only a little work on comp:
```python
def comp(i, j):
    _i, _i_rest = i.split('.', 1)
    _j, _j_rest = j.split('.', 1)
    if _i == _j:
        return comp(_i_rest, _j_rest)
    return primitive_comp(_i, _j)
```

### 2.5.11

no need to modiyf one method: comp.

instead of comparing _i, j_ directly, compare the items at specified index array ``p``. also do the same work on ``exch`` function, exchange i, j in the array ``p``.


### 2.5.14 sort by reverse domain

use the ``key`` parameter in python sorted.

```python
def reverse_domian_sort(domains):
    return sorted(domains, key=lambda d: d.split('.')[::-1], reverse=True)
```    

### 2.5.16 Unbiased election.

compare the index of 2 items instead of their value
```python
def california(values):
    cand = ['R', 'W', ..., 'L']
    return sorted(values, key=lambda v: cand.find(v))
```    

### 2.5.19 Kendall tau distance.

In insertion sort, the inversions count is the number of exchanges. So to find the ``kendall tau distance``, we should try to sort array b to array a, use the item position in array a as the key for array b.

Also, the algs4 website give a java version:

generate a ``newb``, then fill the array with the position of the item in array a. see http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/25applications/KendallTau.java.html

### 2.5.21 Multidimensional sort

python's list compare just works.

### 2.5.30 Boerner's theorem.

__True or false: If you sort each column of a matrix, then sort each row, the columns are still sorted. Justify your answer.__

True. Assume we have a matrix, all columns sorted. Now we have to analysis the following scenrios:

```
A00  A01

A10  A11
```

1. A01 < A00, exchange A00 A01, then A01 < A10, A00 < A11 still works
2. A11 < A10, exchange A10 A11, then A01 < A10, A00 < A11 still works
