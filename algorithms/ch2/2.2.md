### 2.2.4

__Does the abstract inplace merge produce proper output if and only if the two input subarrays are in sorted order? Prove your answer, or provide a counterexample. __

Yes. Here is a counterexample:

the 1st subarray

> 1 2 4 3

the 2nd subarray

> 6 7 8 9

and the result

> 1 2 4 3 6 7 8 9

### 2.2.7

__ Show than the number of compares used by mergesort is monotonically increaseing (C(N+1) > C(N) for all N > 0)__

if N is odd, then the last pair of N+1 list has 2 items, instead of 1; if N is even, then N+1 list has more pairs than N-length list.

### 2.2.8

__Suppose that top-down mergesort is modified to skip the call on merge() whenever a[mid] <= a[mid+1]. Prove that the number of compares used for an array in sorted order is linear.__

If we check a[mid] <= a[mid+1], then return the merge operation for the merge() method, then only the mid vs mid+1 compare are invoked; and check the merge-sort tree, every 2 items nearby will all be compared, so number of compares is linear.
