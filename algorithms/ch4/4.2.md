### 4.2.19 Topological sort and BFS

__Explain why the following algorithm does not necessarily produce a topological order: Run BFS, and label the vertices by increasing distance to their respective source.__

Let's take the following digraph as an example:

> 1 -> 2
> 2 -> 3
> 3 -> 4
> 1 -> 4


If we use DFS, the order is

> 1 2 3 4

but if we use BFS, the order is

> 1 2 4 3
 which is obviously wrong, because 4 appears before 3

### 4.2.20 Directed Eulerian cycle

__Hint: Prove that a digraph G has a directed Eulerian cycle if and only if vertex in G has its indegree equal to its outdegree and all vertices with nonzero degree belong to the same strong component.__

We just ignore which 2 vertices are connected by an edge, just put all the vertices together, in a collection(let's call it ``C``), with indegrees on left, outdegrees on the right. any time we walk through an edge, we can connect a outdegree on the right, with a indegree on the left; if all vertices has the same indegrees and outdegrees, then their will be no indegrees/outgrees left blank in ``C`` after we travel all edges.

So to resolve this, we just check all the vectices has the same in/out-degrees


### 4.2.21 LCA of a DAG

get the height for both v and w, check the route from to v/w, and find the baiggest common vertex.


### 4.2.23 Strong component

__Describe a linear-time algorithm for computing the strong component containing a given vertex v. On the basis of that algorithm, describe a simple quadratic-time algorithm for computing the strong components of a digraph.__

I got the explain here:  http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42directed/

```
 To compute the strong component containing s
 Find the set of vertices reachable from s
 Find the set of vertices that can reach s
 Take the intersection of the two sets
```

### 4.2.24 Hamiltonian path in DAGs.

__Given a DAG, design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether there is a directed path that visits each vertex exactly once.__

Answer:

```
Solution: Compute a topological sort and check if there is an edge between each consecutive pair of vertices in the topological order.
```

See 4.2.24.py

### 4.2.25 Unique topological ordering

__Design an algorithm to determine whether a digraph has a unique topological ordering.__


```
Hint: a digraph has a unique topological ordering if and only if there is a directed edge between each pair of consecutive vertices in the topological order (i.e., the digraph has a Hamiltonian path). If the digraph has multiple topological orderings, then a second topological order can be obtained by swapping a pair of consecutive vertices.
```

Let's talk about this:

```
1 -> 2
3 -> 2
```
so the
```
1 3 2
```

can be the topological order, since there isn't an edge from 1 to 3, so we can also write the topological order to

```
3 1 2
```

### 4.2.20 Queue-based topological sort

We got a queue, which holds the vertices whose indegrees are zero. Also a vertex-indegree dict, the following is using the
queue and dict for topological sort

1. remove a vertex from the queue, and put it to the result list
2. Decrease all the indegrees of  vertex pointed-by-the removed vertex in step 1(there is an edge v -> w)
3. if any vertex has a indegree zero, add it to the queue
