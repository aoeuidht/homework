### 4.1.1

__What is the maximum number of edges in a graph with V vertices and no parallel edges? What is the minimum number of edges in a graph with V vertices, none of which are isolated?__

the maximum is C_n^2, and the minum in n-1

### 4.1.4 hasEdge

see graph.py

### 4.1.13 distTo

__Add a distTo() method to the BreadthFirstPaths API and implementation, which returns the number of edges on the shortest path from the source to a given vertex. A distTo() query should run in constant time.__

just add the distance so far as a parameter. See 4.1.13.py

### 4.1.14

__Use stack instead of queue when running breadth-first search, does it still compute shortest path?__

NO. It's not a breath-first, it a depth-first search.

### 4.1.16

all these problems can be resolved by the bfs.

### 4.1.18 The girth of graph

I got this one: http://theory.stanford.edu/~virgi/cs267/lecture3.pdf

### 4.1.36 Two-edge connectivity.

__A bridge in a graph is an edge that, if removed, would separate a connected graph into two disjoint subgraphs. A graph that has no bridges is said to be two-edge connected. Develop a DFS-based data type Bridge.java for determining whether a given graph is edge connected.__

If we want to check s-w is a bridge of the graph, just start to travel use dfs, ignore the edge w-s, and check weather we can reach vertex w or not.
