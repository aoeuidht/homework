# 3Sum Closest

## Question

Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.


```
For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

## Solution

Since we are looking for the most closet 3 numbers, we just lock the first 2 numbers, and use binary search for the 3rd one -- just not for a specify number.

e.g. The target is 10, and we have 2 nums: 2 and 3, so what we are looking for is a num that __not larger__ than 5, so in array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], __5__  is the answer we want.

```python
    def find_biggest_not_large(self, num, lo, hi, tgt):
        if lo > hi:
            # this only happen when mv > tgt
            # so we only return lo - 1
            return lo - 1
        if (lo == hi):
            if num[lo] > tgt:
                return lo - 1
            else:
                return lo

        mid = (lo + hi) / 2
        mv = num[mid]
        if mv > tgt:
            return self.find_biggest_not_large(num, lo, mid-1, tgt)
        else:
            return self.find_biggest_not_large(num, mid+1, hi, tgt)
```

the left are just loop the array, bind every two numbers, and loop for the rest ones using __find_biggest_not_large__.
