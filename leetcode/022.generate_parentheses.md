# Generate Parentheses

## Question

Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

For example, given n = 3, a solution set is:

```
"((()))", "(()())", "(())()", "()(())", "()()()"
```

## Solution

_Suppose we have a half-done result list, __l__ left parentheses and __r__ right parentheses, then what we should do next?_

we have the following screarios:

* if __l__ is smaller than __r__, __l__ is zero, then we have to append add all right parentheses to every half-done result item
* if __l__ is smaller than __r__, __l__ not zero, then we can:
  * append ")" to half-done items, subtract 1 from __r__
  * append "(" to half-done items, subtract 1 from __l__
* if __l__ is equals to __r__, __l__ not zero, then we can append "(" to half-done items and subtract 1 from __l__
* if __l__ is equals to __r__, __l__ zero, terminate the predure
* init the hald-done items to blank on the program start


so we can resolve this by a simple recursion.
