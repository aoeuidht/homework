# Merge k Sorted Lists

## Question

Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity.

## Solution

I think it's pretty easy to give a way:

* use a new header node to save the result
* get the minimum head in the candidates
* append the minimum _head_ to the resurt list, and move the _head->next_ to the new head

So we have only one problem:

__How can we get the minimum head between N lists?__

The answer is __minimun heap__, and it takes lg^N to rebuild the heap to put the minimum item to the top of the heap (python have a build-in heapq to use a list as a heap). So the solution works like:

1. append all list heads to a heap(list)
2. append the head of the 0-th list to the result
3. make the head of the 0-th list to head->next
4. re-format the heap, then goto step 2
5. terminate if the list is blank

_If you are using python, there is a heapq.heappushpop can makes you do step 3, step 4 in one function call._
