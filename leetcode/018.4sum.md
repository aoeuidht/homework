# 4Sum

## Question

Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c, and d in S such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

__Note:__


* Elements in a quadruplet (a,b,c,d) must be in non-descending order. _(ie, a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d)_


* The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

```
For example, given array S = {1 0 -1 0 -2 2}, and target = 0.

A solution set is:
(-1,  0, 0, 1)
(-2, -1, 1, 2)
(-2,  0, 0, 2)
```


## Solution

Just follow how 2sum works, we combine the numbers 2 by 2, and get a dict (__sum_dict__) save the sum and the numbers. After we finish the combination, we get all the keys out in a list(__cand__), sort the list in ascender order, and use a _header_ and a _tail_ pointer point to the begining and the end of the list. now we have 3 scenarios:

* target == cand[head] + cand[tail], then add the intersection of sum_dict[cand[head]] and sum_dict[cand[tail]]
* target > cand[head] + cand[tail], then we have to move the head pointer forward
* otherwise, move the tail pointer backward.

~~In fact, we can optimize the solution a little bit: split the initial list(l1, l2) to 2 parts: the one that smaller than target/4, and the one bigger than. then use 2 lists(c1, c2) for the 2-sum of the l1 and l2, then search targens with one resurt in c1 and the other one in c2.~~
